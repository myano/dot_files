This is a repo of my dot_files that I use across several machines.

On most machines the vim/ folder will work, however if it doesn't work, rename it to .vim/

Quick way to refresh changes to Xmodmap is by running this command: xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap

To symlink everything, assuming I'm using the username 'yano' run the following command: ln -s ~/dot_files/.bashrc ~/.bashrc && ln -s ~/dot_files/.vimrc ~/.vimrc && ln -s ~/dot_files/vim ~/.vim && ln -s ~/dot_files/.xmodmap ~/.xmodmap && ln -s ~/dot_files/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
